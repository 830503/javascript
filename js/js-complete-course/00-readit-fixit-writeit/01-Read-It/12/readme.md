## EX 12
* Notice the difference with the previous exercise.
* Why is there no 'return' in the parseMovieData function?

Because 'const parseMovieData = movie' is an arrow function. In this function, there is only one statement, and the statement retuns one value, then keyword 'return' can be removed.
