* The for-loop is no longer present. 
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?
* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
  What parameter do we pass to this function?
* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do? 
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?

  1, For loop was repalced by arrow function, which allow us to write shorter function syntax,it remove word 'function', and use => .


  2, We past parameter "title" to this function, then change the title to lowercase in the list. 

  3, 'wrapWithTag' fuction give a lower case. In arrow function, multiple parameters require parentheses.
